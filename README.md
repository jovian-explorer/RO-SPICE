The following code helps the user to get the geometries involved in an RO experiment without having to go through the trouble of learning SPICE. The user just needs to load the kernels of the bodies in question in their study, change the names and dates accordingly, and get the desired values in the form of a csv.
Work is pending in the form of adding the time resolution option to the code, as right now it only uses a resolution of 1 sec. Input functions instead of having to change names/NAIF IDs also pending as of now.
